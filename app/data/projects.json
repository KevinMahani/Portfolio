Each pad is color-coded and reacts to user input by changing its opacity to reflect its state. The project demonstrates dynamic styling, state sharing between components, and controlled state updates in a React environment.\n\nKey Features:\n- Dynamic Grid UI: An 8-pad interface arranged in a 4x2 responsive grid layout using CSS Grid. Each pad has a unique background color and toggles between active (on) and inactive states with visual feedback (opacity changes).\n- State Management in React: Uses useState() to manage pad states at the top level (App component). Pad state is updated immutably through a toggle(id) function that updates the selected pad by id.\n- Reusable Component Architecture: The Pad component is reusable and receives props like id, color, on, and the toggle handler. State is lifted and managed at the parent level for consistent updates.\n- Simple, Clean Styling: CSS provides a dark theme with styled interactive elements. Active pads have full opacity, while inactive ones are dimmed.\n- Dark Mode Support: Accepts a darkMode prop to demonstrate basic theming.\n\nTechnologies Used:\n- React (Functional Components with Hooks)\n- CSS Grid and Flexbox for Layout\n- Modular Component Design\n- JavaScript ES6+\n\nWhat I Learned:\n- Managing and updating complex state structures in React.\n- Building component-based architecture and passing event handlers via props.\n- Applying conditional styling and classNames based on component state.\n- Maintaining immutability in state updates for predictable rendering.\n\nUse Case & Purpose:\nThis project was built as a foundational exercise in UI interactivity and state management. While it doesn't include sound playback, it's a strong base for expanding into an interactive soundboard or MIDI controller.\n\nFuture Ideas:\n- Add sound playback using the Web Audio API or HTML5 Audio.\n- Expand grid size dynamically.\n- Implement keyboard shortcuts to toggle pads.\n- Save and load pad configurations.",
